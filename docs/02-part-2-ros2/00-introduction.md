# Part 2: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Module Overview
**Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)** is the industry standard middleware for robotics. It provides the plumbing—the messaging, tools, and libraries—that allows different parts of a robot (camera, motor, brain) to talk to each other in real-time.

## Learning Objectives
In this module, you will:
*   Install and configure a **ROS 2 Workspace**.
*   Understand the **Graph Architecture**: Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions.
*   Master **URDF** to describe your robot's body.
*   Use **Launch Files** to manage complex systems.
