# Part 3: Simulation & Digital Twins

## Module Overview
Testing code on a real $50,000 humanoid is dangerous. Simulation provides a safe, scalable environment to train and verify your algorithms before deploying them to reality.

## Learning Objectives
In this module, you will:
*   Simulate physics (gravity, collision, friction) using **Gazebo**.
*   Create photorealistic environments with **Unity**.
*   Model sensors (LiDAR, Camera) with realistic noise artifacts.
*   Understand the **Sim-to-Real** workflow.

## Chapters
*   **[Chapter 4: Gazebo & Physics](./01-chapter-4-gazebo.md)**
*   **[Chapter 5: High-Fidelity Simulation](./02-chapter-5-unity-simulation.md)**
