# Part 5: Motion & Control

## Module Overview
A humanoid robot isn't useful if it can't move. This module covers the complex control theory and modern AI approaches required to make a bipedal robot walk, balance, and navigate a human environment.

## Learning Objectives
In this module, you will:
*   Understand the physics of **Bipedal Locomotion** (ZMP, Inverted Pendulum).
*   Train **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** policies for robust walking.
*   Navigate the world using the **ROS 2 Nav2** stack.

## Chapters
*   **[Chapter 8: Humanoid Locomotion](./01-chapter-8-locomotion.md)**
